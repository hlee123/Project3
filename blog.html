    <p class="blog2">I bought ticket for boat tour for $37, and the ticket box is located Michigan Ave, under DuSable Bridge. My ticket is Lake & River Architecture Tour to see Many Architecture at sunset and night.</p>
    <p class="blog2">Tickets prices are a little expensive but I strongly recommend them. Because through this tour, you can see a view of downtown chicago.</p>
